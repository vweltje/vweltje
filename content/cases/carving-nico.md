  This was a quick but fun project to take on. My uncle asked me if I could code
  up a simple site for him to list some of his work and where he could express
  his passion for wood carving.


  I crafted this site with Yellow Cake, a starter kit I developed in the past, see case. I choose to use this starter kit as it suites perfectly with the requirements.
