  Here I crafted a complete custom WordPress theme. One of the key plugins used
  is Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), this plugin adds the ability to create custom
  fields for WordPress pages and/or posts, this allowed me to craft fully
  customizable page templates, forms and clicktools. In turn this made it
  possible to implement external API systems in the backend.


  The first API implemented was the [Insightly API](https://api.insightly.com/), this connects us to a CRM system, so when a form is submitted the data can go directly into the that system as well.


  Another implemented API the [KVK API](https://developers.kvk.nl/), this API contains all businesses of the Netherlands. In this project it is being used to automatically fetch the corresponding business number by a company name.


  Clicktools were also a fun and somewhat challenging feature to work on. A clicktool is basically a survey with several possible pathways to follow. Which path is being followed depends on the given answers. Each question has its own points and sub questions. In the end the user will get a PDF with their personal results listed.

  This was a very fun project to work on and had lots of fun and challenging features. Checkout the [live site](https://www.mvonederland.nl/) to see the theme rocking.
