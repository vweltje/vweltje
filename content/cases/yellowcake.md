  This is a starter kit for Netlify and Netlify CMS. I developed this kit in
  collaboration of my colleges at Thrive Web. We were in the need of a kit that
  could speed up our development time of future projects. So we started thinking
  and looking into other starter kits. But eventually we merged existing code
  from several projects into this one starter kit.


  It features:


  * [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator

  * [Netlify CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms) for content management

  * Dynamic menus and forms

  * [Uploadcare](https://uploadcare.com/) integration

  * Fully responsive layout for mobile and widescreen browsing

  * Blog searching and paging functionality

  * Seamless image and content sliders

  * Instagram feed integration


  Check out the kit [here](https://yellowcake.netlify.com/) or even start your own project with it by grabbing a copy from [GitHub](https://github.com/thriveweb/yellowcake).
