  This is my first ever made web shop. At this stage I was still a trainee at
  Thrive Web and they were confident that I could make a web shop happening. And
  right they were. I learned a lot of this project and glad that I took on the
  challenge.


  This site is powered by WordPress and WooCommerce which gave it itâ€™s web shop behaviour. Check out the [site](http://theundercurrent.com.au/) and see my work in action.
