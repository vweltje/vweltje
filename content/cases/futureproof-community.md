  This was a redesign of an existing site built with
  [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/), a PHP framework. I worked on this
  project along with two other developers, an API developer, Redux wizard and me
  the pixel pusher. My main focus was styling up the page and components and
  handling their individual states.


  As design system I choose to make use of Googleâ€™s [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/). This design system speared me the hassle of developing all kinds of basic components and behaviours. This UI system was new to me but was very worthwhile using.
