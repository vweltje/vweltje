firstSection:

    Yeah that’s me, Vincent Weltje. I am a full stack web developer specialised
    in front-end techniques. I enjoy spending that extra mile to craft
    rock-solid, blazing fast and easy to use websites and web apps.


    My passion for ICT started when I was still a young bloke in primary school. I liked to muck around with old computers and make something working out of old scrape parts. As I grew older I explored the beauty of creating my own scripts to automate things such as automatic cookie and temp file cleaning. In high school I had the option to choose a so called specialisation route and lucky for me, ICT appeared to be one of them. So no doubt, I signed up and that was the beginning of my ICT carrier.


    By this date I am a graduated media developer with nearly five years of experience in the branch. In those years I had the opportunity to work on my development skills in both my home country The Netherlands and abroad in Australia. In both places I worked as a full stack web developer mainly with React and PHP.

    ### Here are some facts about me:


    * I strive for quality, when I see potential improvement, I bring it to the table.

    * I love to work in teams and let every participant do what they are good at.

    * I love traveling, at this stage I visited five of the seven continents and spend roughly 13% of my life abroad. 

    * I have an affection to everything related to the outdoors, climbing, surfing, mountain biking, hiking, scuba diving, sailing and so on. Basically everything active in the fresh open air.


    > Creativity and love for pushing pixels is key to build epic web experienced that blow people’s minds.
